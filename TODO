current bugs:
-uh shitty buying system?

currently working on:
-buying system
-port everything from Lua Lag Compensation (which is really an entire hit detection system)
-arguments that override server.cfg and default settings (such as -off for offline-mode)

will be working on in near future:
-replace default settings in settings.c with sys/server.cfg (iirc the last time i tried server.cfg it was very buggy)
-add many server commands from standard cs2d (like sv_name).
-new server options
--sv_maxmoney (let be default: 16000)
--sv_automoney (toggle automoney)
-HE grenades
--will need to do many measurements in cs2d to figure out how the explosion damages are calculated.
-standard gamemode
--figure out how much money is given for each won/lost round
--bomb plant/defuse
-various map entities
-rcon
--auto rcon login for certain usgn's or ip's
-10 million "not implemented" packets the client may send
--/kill
--sprays
-fix logging stuff for non-windows

not going to be implemented:
-hostages, unless many many people request it.
--cs gamemode isn't very popular anyway...
-stupid fun stuff that has polluted cs2d
--zombies
--npcs
--all weapons you can't buy. and superarmor and that junk.
-construction
--i honestly don't see how construction servers will benefit from using a custom server.
-anything having to do with windows.
--first, running from windows = home server. home server = laggy connection + bad for competitive gameplay.
--secondly, i'm pretty sure you can just use cygwin to compile
-bots

done:
-wayyyy better fps control
--already got the code down... just need to copy and paste some stuff into src/main.c
-fill out weapons table in src/weapons.c
--i'm using the itemtype function in cs2d lua to generate the table :D
